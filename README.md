# 📝 CLI Notes App (Python)

A simple command-line based Notes Management System built with Python.
It supports user authentication, note creation, search, and deletion, with file-based storage and basic logging.

This project demonstrates OOP design, input validation, file handling, and modular architecture in Python.

## 🚀 Features
- User Registration & Login
- 📝 Add Notes with auto-generated IDs & timestamps
- 📖 View all notes
- 🔍 Search notes by keyword
- 🗑️ Delete notes by ID
- 📂 File-based storage per user
- ⚠️ Error logging system
- ✅ Input validation for users and notes

## 🏗️ Project Structure
- notes_app.py
- users.txt              # Stores registered users (auto-created)
- <username>_notes.txt   # Notes file per user (auto-created)
- error.log              # Application error logs

## 🧠 Architecture
- The application follows an object-oriented design:
- Class	Responsibility
- Note	Represents a single note with ID, content, timestamp
- User	Stores user credentials and note file mapping
- Validator	Validates usernames, passwords, note content, and IDs
- FileManager	Handles file read/write/append operations
- AuthManager	Manages user registration and login
- NotesManager	Handles note CRUD operations and search
- Logger	Logs errors and info messages to error.log
- NotesApp	Main CLI controller and menu navigation

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- No external dependencies (uses only Python standard library)

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
python notes_app.py
```

### 🖥️ Usage Flow

#### 1️⃣ Start Menu

------------------------------
### 🔐 Data Storage
- User credentials are stored in: users.txt
- Each user gets a separate notes file: <username>_notes.txt

### ⚠️ Passwords are stored in plain text (for learning purposes only).
- Do not use this approach in production.

### 🪵 Logging
- All unexpected errors are recorded in: error.log

# ⚠️ Known Issues / Limitations
- Passwords are not hashed (security improvement needed)
- Notes are stored as plain text instead of structured format (e.g., JSON/DB)
- No pagination for large note sets
- Minor typo bug in delete_note(): notes_in.strop()
- should be: notes_in.strip()

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- 🔒 Password hashing (bcrypt)
- 🗃️ SQLite or PostgreSQL integration
- 🖥️ GUI version (Tkinter / PyQt)
- 🌐 REST API (Flask/FastAPI)
- 🏷️ Note tagging & categories
- 📅 Date-based filtering
- 📤 Export notes to Markdown/PDF


## 🧪 Learning Outcomes
- This project helps practice:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File handling in Python
- CLI application design
- Input validation
- Separation of concerns
- Basic authentication logic
- Logging and error handling
